title: Multitenancy and current session

Today let's discuss the interaction between multitenancy and the _current session_ feature.

Multitenancy let's you isolate `Session` operations between different tenants.
This is useful to create a single application isolating different customers from one another.

The _current session_ feature returns the same session for a given context, typically a (JTA) transaction.
This facilitates the one session per view/transaction/conversation pattern and avoid the one session per operation anti-pattern.

[source,java]
----
Session session = sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();
// do some other work
[...]
// later in the same context (e.g. JTA Transaction)
Session session2 = sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();

// semantically we have
assert session == session2
----

The two features work well together,
you simply implement
http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.3/devguide/en-US/html_single/#d5e4871[CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver]
that will give Hibernate ORM the expected tenant id when the current session is created.

== How current is current?

When discussing with Florian and the http://www.toulousejug.org[ToulouseJUG],
we exchanged on a small case where things might not work as you expect.
Hibernate ORM considers that, for a given context (e.g. transaction),
there can only be a single current `Session`.

So if in the same context (e.g. transaction):

* your `CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver` implementation returns different values of tenant id,
* you use `getCurrentSession()`

you will get a `TenantIdentifierMismatchException`.

However, it is sometimes useful to be able to reach several tenants from the same context.
You have two options:

* Manually create the `Session`
* Implement your custom `CurrentSessionContext`

== Manually create the `Session`

You can use the `SessionFactory` API to create a `Session` for the tenant id you are looking for.

[source,java]
----
Session session1 = sessionFactory.withOptions()
        .tenantIdentifier( tenant1 )
        ...
        .openSession();
Session session2 = sessionFactory.withOptions()
        .tenantIdentifier( tenant2 )
        ...
        .openSession();
----

But you have to make sure to close these sessions.
If you are used to CDI or Spring handling sessions for you,
or if you rely on the current session feature to propagate the session across your stack,
this might be annoying.

== Implement your custom `CurrentSessionContext`

The alternative is to implement your own version of `CurrentSessionContext`,
avoid raising the `TenantIdentifierMismatchException`,
and keep `Session` instances per both context and tenant id.

In practice, current sessions are stored in a `ConcurrentHashMap` keyed by context identifier,
you just need to improve that part.
Start with https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/d0c2c31ab7217da32eee2a82457eb321a3aebbaa/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/context/internal/JTASessionContext.java[JTASessionContext]
and hack away!

== What now?

We are currently discussing whether the default `CurrentSessionContext` implementations
should partition by tenant id or raise the exception.
If you have your opinion, https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-9766[chime in]!

In the mean time, use one of the options above.
